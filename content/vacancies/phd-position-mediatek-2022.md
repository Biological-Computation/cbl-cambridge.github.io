We invite applications for a PhD position funded by a DTP CASE studentship, to work
on meta-learning from a dual machine-learning and biological perspective.
The position is fully funded for 3 years starting October 2022, and the candidate will be supervised
jointly by Guillaume Hennequin (Cambridge University) and Alberto Bernacchia (Mediatek Research, Cambridge).
The candidate will be expected to spend at least 3 months at Mediatek.

Please email [Guillaume Hennequin](mailto:g.hennequin@eng.cam.ac.uk) and [Alberto Bernacchia](mailto:ab2349@cam.ac.uk) to express interest.
Interviews will begin mid-January, with decisions made before the end of March.
