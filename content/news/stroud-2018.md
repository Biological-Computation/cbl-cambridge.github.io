Congratulations [Jake](https://jakepstroud.github.io) on a great
PhD thesis, and a cool paper now in press at Nature Neuroscience!

### Abstract

Motor cortex (M1) exhibits a rich repertoire of activities to
support the generation of complex movements. Although recent neuronal network
models capture many qualitative aspects of M1 dynamics, they can generate only
a few distinct movements. Additionally, it is unclear how M1 efficiently
controls movements over a wide range of shapes and speeds. We demonstrate that
simple modulation of neuronal input --- output gains in recurrent neuronal
network models with fixed connectivity can dramatically reorganize neuronal
activity and consequently downstream muscle outputs. Consistent with the
observation of diffuse neuromodulatory projections to M1, we show that a
relatively small number of modulatory control units provide sufficient
flexibility to adjust high-dimensional network activity using a simple
reward-based learning rule.  Furthermore, novel movements can be assembled from
previously-learned primitives and we can separately change movement speed while
preserving movement shape. Our results provide a new perspective on the role of
modulatory systems in controlling recurrent cortical activity.
