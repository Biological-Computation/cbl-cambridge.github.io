Computation in the brain occurs through complex interactions in highly
structured, non-random networks. Moving beyond traditional approaches based on
statistical physics, engineering-based approaches are bringing new vistas on
circuit computation, by providing novel ways of
- building artificial yet fully functional model circuits,
- dissecting their dynamics to identify new circuit mechanisms, and
- reasoning about population recordings made in diverse brain areas across a
  range of sensory, motor, and cognitive tasks.
Thus, the same "science of real-world problems" that is behind the accumulation
of increasingly rich neural datasets is now also being recognized as a vast and
useful set of tools for their analysis.

This workshop aims at bringing together researchers who build and study
structured network models, spiking or otherwise, that serve specific functions.
Our speakers will present their neuroscientific work at the confluence of
machine learning, optimization, control theory, dynamical systems, and other
engineering fields, to help us understand these recent developments, critically
evaluate their scope and limitations, and discuss their use for elucidating the
neural basis of intelligent behaviour.
