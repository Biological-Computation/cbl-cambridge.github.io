<!-- Abstract here please. -->

A major challenge in systems neuroscience is to understand how the dynamics of
neural circuits give rise to behaviour. Analysis of complex dynamical systems is
also at the heart of control engineering, where it is central to the design of
robust control strategies. Although a rich engineering literature has grown over
decades to facilitate the analysis of such systems, little of it has percolated
into neuroscience so far. Here, we give a brief introduction to a number of core
control-theoretic concepts that provide useful perspectives on neural circuit
dynamics. We introduce important mathematical tools related to these concepts,
and establish connections to neural circuit analysis, focusing on a number of
themes that have arisen from the modern ‘state-space’ view on neural population
dynamics.
