Spike-frequency adaptation is known to enhance the transmission of information
in sensory spiking neurons by rescaling the dynamic range for input processing,
matching it to the temporal statistics of the sensory stimulus. Achieving
maximal information transmission has also been recently postulated as a role
for spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP). However, the link between optimal
plasticity and STDP in cortex remains loose, as does the relationship between
STDP and adaptation processes. We investigate how STDP, as described by recent
minimal models derived from experimental data, influences the quality of
information transmission in an adapting neuron. We show that a phenomenological
model based on triplets of spikes yields almost the same information rate as an
optimal model specially designed to this end. In contrast, the standard
pair-based model of STDP does not improve information transmission as much.
This result holds not only for additive STDP with hard weight bounds, known to
produce bimodal distributions of synaptic weights, but also for
weight-dependent STDP in the context of unimodal but skewed weight
distributions. We analyze the similarities between the triplet model and the
optimal learning rule, and find that the triplet effect is an important feature
of the optimal model when the neuron is adaptive. If STDP is optimized for
information transmission, it must take into account the dynamical properties of
the postsynaptic cell, which might explain the target-cell specificity of STDP.
In particular, it accounts for the differences found in vitro between STDP at
excitatory synapses onto principal cells and those onto fast-spiking
interneurons.
