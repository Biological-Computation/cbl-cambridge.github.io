<!-- Abstract here please (you can use Markdown) -->

When stimulated, neural populations in the visual cortex exhibit fast rhythmic activity with frequencies in the gamma band (30-80 Hz). The gamma rhythm manifests as a broad resonance peak in the power-spectrum of recorded local field potentials which exhibits various stimulus dependencies. In particular, in macaque primary visual cortex (V1), the gamma peak frequency increases with increasing stimulus contrast. Moreover, this contrast dependence is local: when contrast varies smoothly over visual space, the gamma peak frequency in each cortical column is controlled by the local contrast in that column's receptive field. No parsimonious mechanistic explanation for these contrast dependencies of V1 gamma oscillations has been proposed. The stabilized supralinear network (SSN) is a mechanistic model of cortical circuits that has accounted for a range of visual cortical response nonlinearities and contextual modulations, as well as their contrast dependence. Here, we begin by showing that a reduced SSN model lacking topography robustly captures the contrast dependence of gamma peak frequency, and provides a mechanistic explanation for this effect based on the observed non-saturating and supralinear input-output function of V1 neurons. Given this result, the local dependence on contrast can trivially be captured in a retinotopically extended SSN which lacks horizontal synaptic connections between cortical columns, as in that case the gamma peak in a cortical column would be independently set by that columnâ€™s feedforward input. However, long-range horizontal connections in V1 are in fact strong, and contextual modulation phenomena such as surround suppression are known to be, in part, mediated by these connections. We thus explored whether a retinotopically organized SSN model of V1 with strong excitatory horizontal connections can exhibit both surround suppression and the local contrast dependence of gamma peak frequency. We found that such a SSN can account for both effects, but only when the excitatory projections are composed of two components with different patterns of spatial fall-off with distance: a short-range component which only targets the source column, combined with a long-range component that targets columns neighboring the source column. We thus make a specific qualitative prediction for the spatial structure of horizontal connections in macaque V1, consistent with the columnar structure of cortex.
