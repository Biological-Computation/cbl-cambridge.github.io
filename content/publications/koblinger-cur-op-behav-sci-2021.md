<!-- Abstract here please (you can use Markdown) -->

Perception is often described as probabilistic inference requiring an internal
representation of uncertainty. However, it is unknown whether uncertainty is
represented in a task-dependent manner, solely at the level of decisions, or in
a fully Bayesian manner, across the entire perceptual pathway. To address this
question, we first codify and evaluate the possible strategies the brain might
use to represent uncertainty, and highlight the normative advantages of fully
Bayesian representations. In such representations, uncertainty information is
explicitly represented at all stages of processing, including early sensory
areas, allowing for flexible and efficient computations in a wide variety of
situations. Next, we critically review neural and behavioral evidence about the
representation of uncertainty in the brain agreeing with fully Bayesian
representations. We argue that sufficient behavioral evidence for fully
Bayesian representations is lacking and suggest experimental approaches for
demonstrating the existence of multivariate posterior distributions along the
perceptual pathway.
