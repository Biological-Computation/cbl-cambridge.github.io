When interacting with complex environments, humans can rapidly adapt their
behavior to changes in task or context. To facilitate this adaptation, we often
spend substantial periods of time contemplating possible futures before acting.
For such planning to be rational, the benefits of planning to future behavior
must at least compensate for the time spent thinking. Here we capture these
features of human behavior by developing a neural network model where not only
actions, but also planning, are controlled by prefrontal cortex. This model
consists of a meta-reinforcement learning agent augmented with the ability to
plan by sampling imagined action sequences drawn from its own policy, which we
refer to as ‘rollouts’. Our results demonstrate that this agent learns to plan
when planning is beneficial, explaining the empirical variability in human
thinking times. Additionally, the patterns of policy rollouts employed by the
artificial agent closely resemble patterns of rodent hippocampal replays
recently recorded in a spatial navigation task, in terms of both their spatial
statistics and their relationship to subsequent behavior. Our work provides a
new theory of how the brain could implement planning through
prefrontal-hippocampal interactions, where hippocampal replays are triggered by
– and in turn adaptively affect – prefrontal dynamics.
