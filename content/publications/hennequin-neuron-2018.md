Correlated variability in cortical activity is ubiquitously quenched following
stimulus onset, in a stimulus-dependent manner. These modulations have been
attributed to circuit dynamics involving either multiple stable states
(«attractors») or chaotic activity. Here we show that a qualitatively different
dynamical regime, involving fluctuations about a single, stimulus-driven
attractor in a loosely balanced excitatory-inhibitory network (the stochastic
[«stabilized supralinear network»](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2014.12.026)),
best explains these modulations. Given the supralinear input/output functions
of cortical neurons, increased stimulus drive strengthens effective network
connectivity. This shifts the balance from interactions that amplify
variability to suppressive inhibitory feedback, quenching correlated
variability around more strongly driven steady states.  Comparing to previously
published and original data analyses, we show that this mechanism, unlike
previous proposals, uniquely accounts for the spatial patterns and fast
temporal dynamics of variability suppression. Specifying the cortical operating
regime is key to understanding the computations underlying perception.

<b>On the cover:</b>
The variability of cortical responses reveals fundamental properties of the
dynamics of the underlying circuit. In this paper, we use patterns of
stimulus-dependent variability in visual cortex to identify specific circuit
mechanisms that generate and control response variability. The cover image is a
photograph of a so-called «Chladni pattern»: as a sound makes a metal plate
vibrate, high- and low-variability regions of the plate are revealed as regions
repelling and attracting small grains of rice. Much like in the cortex,
patterns of variability arise as an interplay between the «stimulus» (the
sound) and the dynamics of the medium (the plate). Photograph by Gergő Orbán,
