During delayed ballistic reaches, motor areas consistently display
movement-specific activity patterns prior to movement onset. It is unclear why
these patterns arise: while they have been proposed to seed an initial neural
state from which the movement unfolds, recent experiments have uncovered the
presence and necessity of ongoing inputs during movement, which may lessen the
need for careful initialization. Here, we modelled the motor cortex as an
input-driven dynamical system, and we asked what the optimal way to control
this system to perform fast delayed reaches is. We find that delay-period
inputs consistently arise in an optimally controlled model of M1. By studying a
variety of network architectures, we could dissect and predict the situations
in which it is beneficial for a network to prepare. Finally, we show that
optimal input-driven control of neural dynamics gives rise to multiple phases
of preparation during reach sequences, providing a novel explanation for
experimentally observed features of monkey M1 activity in double reaching.
