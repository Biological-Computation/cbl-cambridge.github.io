Hebbian changes of excitatory synapses are driven by and further enhance
correlations between pre- and postsynaptic activities. Hence, Hebbian
plasticity forms a positive feedback loop that can lead to instability in
simulated neural networks.  To keep activity at healthy, low levels, plasticity
must therefore incorporate homeostatic control mechanisms. We find in numerical
simulations of recurrent networks with a realistic triplet-based
spike-timing-dependent plasticity rule (triplet STDP) that homeostasis has to
detect rate changes on a timescale of seconds to minutes to keep the activity
stable. We confirm this result in a generic mean-field formulation of network
activity and homeostatic plasticity. Our results strongly suggest the existence
of a homeostatic regulatory mechanism that reacts to firing rate changes on the
order of seconds to minutes.
