We develop and study intelligent interfaces that enhance the productivity and experience of users. Our goal is to fully exploit the advantages offered by advanced machine intelligence when applied in tightly coupled human-machine systems. This research larges sits within the area of human-computer interaction but draws on techniques from machine learning, computer vision and robotics.
