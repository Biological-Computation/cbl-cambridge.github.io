Hi! I’m Tim, a first year PhD student in the Machine Learning Group at Cambridge University
Engineering Department. I am supervised by [Hong Ge](http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/hong/) and advised by
[José Miguel Hernández-Lobato](https://jmhl.org/). My research is focused on computational
statistics, covering Bayesian inference, Monte Carlo methods and statistical learning. Application
areas of interest include quantitative finance and chemistry. My background is in statistics, having
completed a BSc in Mathematics and Statistics at the University of Warwick before undertaking Part
III Mathematical Statistics at the University of Cambridge.
