Hi! I’m Tim, a first year PhD student in the Machine Learning Group at  
Cambridge University Engineering Department. I am co-supervised by [Hong
Ge](http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/hong/) and [José Miguel
Hernández-Lobato](https://jmhl.org/). My research is focused on
computational statistics, covering Bayesian inference, Monte Carlo
methods and statistical learning. Application areas of interest include
quantitative finance and chemistry. My background is in statistics,
having completed a BSc in Mathematics and Statistics at the University
of Warwick before undertaking Part III Mathematical Statistics at the
University of Cambridge.
