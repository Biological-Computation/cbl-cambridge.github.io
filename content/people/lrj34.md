Luke studied a BA in Engineering at Oxford before joining the group in 2022 to
undertake an MPhil by Research, funded in part by an Amma-Kyei Mensah
scholarship. His project examines meta-learning across artificial and
biological agents, with links to the work of Marco Tripodi's lab (MRC
Laboratory of Molecular Biology) on the representation of space in the mouse
brain.
