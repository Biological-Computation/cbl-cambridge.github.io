I am a PhD student in Machine Learning at University of Cambridge (Department of Engineering) and Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems (Empirical Inference Department). My supervisors are Professor José Miguel Hernández-Lobato and Professor Bernhard Schölkopf. My advisor is Dr Hong Ge.

I am keen on basic research in machine learning and its scientific applications (e.g., drug discovery). My research interest lies at the intersection of probabilistic methods, deep learning, and causal inference. I aim to develop data-efficient machine learning methods that enable active data collection, robust inference and prediction, efficient data compression, and realistic generation of novel synthetic data.
