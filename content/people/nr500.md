I'm a PhD student co-advised by Ferenc Husz√°r and David Krueger, and am funded by a scholarship from Twitter. I completed my MSc at Mila (Montreal) where I variously worked on empirical evaluation of generalization bounds, data-efficient reinforcement learning using self-supervised learning, and measuring capabilities of large language models. My research focus is on empirical approaches to understanding how deep learning works, especially at scale, and I am also interested in policy considerations for the responsible development of AGI.
