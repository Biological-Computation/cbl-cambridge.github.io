Alejandro joined the group as a postdoc at the end of 2022. After studying
physics and artificial intelligence in Spain he did his PhD in computational
neuroscience in the UK. From 2017 to 2022 he combined modelling and human
neuroimaging to study representational learning in the auditory brain. He is
currently interested in understanding how the brain uses Bayesian inference to
make sense of the sensory world.
