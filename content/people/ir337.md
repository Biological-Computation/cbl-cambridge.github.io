I’m a first-year PhD student supervised by Adrian Weller and a member of
Trinity College. I obtained my Master of Physics degree at the University of
Oxford, where I researched the dynamics of quantum entanglement in locally
interacting systems. I’m interested in probabilistic machine learning,
including how we can perform effective and computationally efficient
approximate inference.
