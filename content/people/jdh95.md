I am a PhD student within the Cambridge Machine Learning group since October 2022. I am supervised
by Dr. José Miguel Hernández-Lobato and supported by the Cambridge Center for AI in Medicine
fellowship. Prior to joining the group, I did my BSc in Mathematics and Computer Science at the
University of Ottawa, followed by an MSc in Computer Science specializing in Machine Learning at the
University of Montreal in affiliation with Mila. I also spent three years at Valence Discovery,
working on the application of ML to small molecules and drug discovery.

My current interests are broadly centered around questions of generalizability and adaptability of
ML models, with a particular emphasis on applications to molecular data.
