I am a PhD student supervised by David Krueger. Prior to my PhD, I completed a
master's degree in computer science at the University of Massachusetts Amherst,
supervised by Prof Andrew Barto. I also obtained a B.Sc. in quantitative
finance from the University of Hong Kong.  My research interests include
reinforcement learning, deep learning, and biologically inspired machine
learning. During my master's studies, I studied biologically plausible
alternatives to backpropagation in training neural networks. My current project
studies how to empower reinforcement learning agents with learned planning
ability such that they can plan according to the situation instead of following
a hand-crafted planning procedure. I believe this way of planning is more
similar to the planning behaviour of animals and can potentially yield agents
with abstract cognitive abilities.
