I am a senior research associate in probabilistic ML advised by Zoubin Ghahramani and Hong Ge in MLG/CBL at Cambridge, working closely with the [Turing team](https://turing.ml/) on probabilistic programming. 

I am interested in Bayesian inference, MCMC methods, generative modelling, learning and reinforcing dynamical systems, etc. 

Prior, I did 3 years Oxford postdoc in CS, spent 2.5 years in UK financial industry, and obtained Oxford DPhil in engineering. I am fortunate to have spent time in multiple groups, working with and learning from great minds on many themes, in both academia and industry.
