I am a PhD student at the University of Cambridge being supervised by David
Krueger. My research interests span Reinforcement Learning, Deep Learning and
Cooperative AI.  My long term goal in AI research is to develop useful,
versatile and human-aligned AI systems that can learn from humans and each
other. In particular, I am interested in exploring ways through which rich human
preferences and desires could be adaptively communicated to the AI agents,
especially in complex scenarios such as multi-agent planning and time-varying
preferences.
