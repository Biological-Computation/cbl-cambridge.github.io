Javier is a PhD student in the Machine Learning Group supervised by Professor José Miguel Hernández-Lobato, starting in October 2019. He received his undergraduate degree in Telecommunications Engineering from the University of Zaragoza, Spain, and his MPhil in Machine Learning from the University of Cambridge, UK, both with distinction. Javier is funded by Microsoft Research through its PhD Scholarship Programme. His interests are broadly in the intersection of probabilistic modelling and deep learning with additional focus on kernel methods, decision theory, information theory and their applications.
