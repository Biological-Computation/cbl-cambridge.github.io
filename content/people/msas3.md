Shoaib is a first-year Ph.D. student at the University of Cambridge supervised by David Krueger. Prior to this, he did his MS from Germany (TU Kaiserslautern) followed by an internship at NVIDIA research. He is broadly interested in the empirical theory of deep learning with an aim to better understand how deep learning models work. In regards to AI alignment, he works on the myopic problem of robustness. He is also particularly interested in understanding and improving self-supervised learning, which is the main ingredient for current large-scale systems.
