I'm a third year PhD student in the machine learning group at Cambridge University Engineering Department, supervised by [Prof Carl Rasmussen](https://cbl-cambridge.org/people/cer54) and advised by [Prof Richard E Turner](https://cbl-cambridge.org/people/ret26). I'm interested in algorithms rooted in modern probabilistic methods, particularly Gaussian processes, for learning models involving physical systems. I'm especially interested in learning dynamical systems (or state-space models) from data, and improving spatio-temporal models.
Previously I studied for my MEng (2013-2017) at the [Engineering department in Cambridge](https://www.undergraduate.study.cam.ac.uk/courses/engineering) where I did my master's project with [Dr Jossy Sayir](https://www-sigproc.eng.cam.ac.uk/Main/JS851), and spent some time in the Information Processing Group at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/schools/ic/ipg/).
