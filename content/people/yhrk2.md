Yul Kang joined the Biological Learning Group in 2018 as a postdoc working with Prof. Máté Lengyel, and was elected a Junior Research Fellow at Wolfson College in 2019. Before he joined the group, he received an MD from Seoul National University in South Korea, and a PhD in Neuroscience from Columbia University in the USA supervised by Michael Shadlen. As a theorist, he finds optimal algorithms to perform cognitive tasks under uncertainty, using probabilistic neural representation models and large-scale numerical optimisation methods, and compares it with data from the literature or experimental collaborators. As a psychophysicist, he performs human behavioural experiments himself. He has applied this approach to areas including perceptual decision-making, spatial navigation, episodic memory, and active sensing.
