Andy joined the CBL group in October 2022 as a PhD student participating in the
Cambridge — Tübingen PhD Fellowships in Machine Learning program and the ELLIS
PhD Program. His research focuses on Bayesian approaches to calibrated
uncertainty estimation in deep learning, particularly function-space methods
and linear models, and he is also interested in information geometry. His
academic supervisors are José Miguel Hernández-Lobato (University of Cambridge,
Professor) and Bernhard Schölkopf (Max Planck Institute for Intelligent
Systems, Director), and his studies and research are funded by the Harding
Distinguished Postgraduate Scholars Programme. Before starting his PhD, Andy
received his B.Sc. in Computer Science and M.Sc. in Autonomous Systems from TU
Darmstadt in Germany, where he worked with Stefan Roth, Jan Peters and Kristian
Kersting and received the Deutschlandstipendium.  He also attended the
University of British Columbia, Stanford University and Aalto University
through student exchange programs and summer sessions, and visited Louisiana
State University as part of the Fulbright's Leaders in Entrepreneurship
program.
