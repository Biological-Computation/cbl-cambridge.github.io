I am a PhD student supervised by Guillaume Hennequin (CBL) and Alberto
Bernacchia (Mediatek Research Cambridge).  Prior to my PhD, I completed the
MPhil in Machine Learning and Machine Intelligence at the University of
Cambridge, supervised by Prof Richard Turner. I also obtained a B.Sc. in
Applied Mathematics from University of Singapore, supervised by Prof Vincent
Tan.

My current project studies meta-learning from a dual machine-learning and
biological perspective. My research interests also include probabilistic
modelling, explainable AI and causal inference. I aim to develop trustworthy
algorithms that combines fast and transferable learning, robustness, and
interpretability.
