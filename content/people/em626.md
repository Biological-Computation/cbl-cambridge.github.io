Hi! My name is Stratis and I am a PhD student in the Machine Learning Group (started in 2020), supervised by Carl Rasmussen and advised by Richard Turner. Previously, I studied for an MPhil in Machine Learning and Machine Intelligence (2018-2019) and a BA in Physics (2015-2018), both in Cambridge. Between the MPhil and the PhD I worked in the Healthcare Intelligence team at Microsoft Research Cambridge (2019-2020), supervised by Ted Meeds. I am broadly interested in probabilistic machine learning, and particularly in effective methods for scaling probabilistic models to impactful areas like climate science and healthcare.
