I joined the Machine Learning Group as an MPhil student in 2022, where I work with Hong Ge on
applying reinforcement learning to probabilistic models. I am also exploring the usability and
interpretability of reinforcement learning systems with insight from Alan Blackwell.  I am funded by
a 2021 Marshall Scholarship, with which I also completed an MSc. in Cognitive Science at the
University of Edinburgh under the supervision of Kobi Gal. Prior to my graduate work, I completed my
BS in Computer Science at NC State University and spent nearly two years as a Software Engineer at
Pendo. Outside of academia, I enjoy hockey, golf, and solving Rubik's cubes.
