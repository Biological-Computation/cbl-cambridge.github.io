I'm a PhD student in the Machine Learning Group supervised by Prof. José Miguel
Hernández-Lobato and advised by Prof. Richard Turner. Previously, I completed my
Masters in Biomedical Engineering from Johns Hopkins University (2017-2019) and
a Bachelors from IIT Delhi (2013-2017). Before starting my PhD, I was an AI
Resident at Google Brain (2017-2019), co-supervised by Jasper Snoek and Balaji
Lakshminarayanan. My research interests lie in calibration and uncertainty
estimation in machine learning, Bayesian deep learning and applications in
biomedicine.
